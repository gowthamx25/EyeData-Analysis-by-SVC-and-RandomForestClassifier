This project focuses on analyzing eye-related data using supervised machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Random Forest Classifier, to build reliable predictive models. The workflow covers data preprocessing, feature handling, model training, and performance evaluation, all implemented in a structured Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and comparison. By evaluating multiple classifiers on the same dataset, the project highlights their strengths and limitations, providing practical insight into model selection and application for real-world data analysis tasks.
